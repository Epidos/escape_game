# 
	today you're gooing to retrace the life of the famous computer scientist ALan Turing into this little escape game.
	Good luck :)


## Thème : Algo et mathématique (la vie de Alan Turing)
	Alan Mathison Turing, bornJune 23, 1912in London and died onJune 7, 1954in Wilmslow, 
	is a British mathematician and cryptologist, author of works which scientifically found computer science.
	
	To solve the fundamental problem of decidability in arithmetic, he presented in 1936 a thought experiment 
	that would later be called the Turing machine and the concepts of programs and programming, which would take 
	on their full meaning with the spread of computers, in the second half of the 20th century. 
	
	His model helped establish Church's thesis, which defines the intuitive mathematical concept of computable function.

### Test 1: Decrypt me if you can
	One of the speciality of Alan Turing was the decryption of message, use all of your nine brain and succeed to decrypt this code.

### Test 3: Calculate me if you can
	You're doing an escape game on Alan Turing and you think you won't do math ? LOL  
#
	(X * 5 + 7) / 6 = 17
	(Y * 8 – 31) / 64/8 = 8.125
	Concat(X, Y) ;
	
### Last test: Crack the binary
	(hint: look at the result of your previous test)
